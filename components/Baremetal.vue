    <p class="subtitle">
      Baremetal is a no-engine no-library Nintendo64 game project.
      It attempts to be as portable as possible to allow for 
      ports to other consoles in the future (Gameboy Advance is a possibility!).
      For now the focus of the project is on getting the engine working.
